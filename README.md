# CipherStack

CipherStack: Advanced Encryption Framework
(A quantum-resilient, coefficient-driven encryption prototype.)

Overview
CipherStack is a state-of-the-art encryption framework designed to handle the increasing demands of modern data security. With features like customizable coefficient-driven encryption, entropy analysis, and quantum-resistant methodologies, CipherStack represents the next step in secure data management.

This project is open-source, enabling the community to contribute, improve, and adapt the framework to real-world needs. While the framework is still in its prototype phase, it showcases the potential of advanced cryptographic techniques.

Features
Coefficient-Driven Encryption: Adds multiple layers of security, making brute-force attacks computationally infeasible.
Entropy Analysis: Validates randomness and strengthens encryption reliability.
Seed Uniqueness: Ensures no two encryption cycles use the same seed, enhancing security.
Hash Integrity Checks: Provides tamper-proof validation of encrypted data.
Boundary Condition Handling: Robust encryption and decryption for edge cases, including empty or massive datasets.
Quantum-Resilient Architecture (Future-Ready): Prepares for the next era of quantum computing with modular integration of post-quantum cryptography.
Performance Metrics: Tracks encryption/decryption performance, aiding in optimization.
